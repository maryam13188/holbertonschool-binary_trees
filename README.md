# Binary Trees Project

## 📖 Description
This project is a comprehensive implementation of binary tree data structures in C, developed as part of the Holberton School curriculum. The goal is to implement various operations and algorithms related to binary trees, binary search trees, and balanced trees.

## 🎯 Tasks

### Task 0: New node
**Function:** `binary_tree_t *binary_tree_node(binary_tree_t *parent, int value)`
- Creates a binary tree node
- Returns pointer to new node, or NULL on failure

### Task 1: Insert left
**Function:** `binary_tree_t *binary_tree_insert_left(binary_tree_t *parent, int value)`
- Inserts a node as the left-child of another node
- If parent already has a left-child, new node takes its place

### Task 2: Insert right
**Function:** `binary_tree_t *binary_tree_insert_right(binary_tree_t *parent, int value)`
- Inserts a node as the right-child of another node
- If parent already has a right-child, new node takes its place

### Task 3: Delete
**Function:** `void binary_tree_delete(binary_tree_t *tree)`
- Deletes an entire binary tree
- Uses post-order traversal

### Task 4: Is leaf
**Function:** `int binary_tree_is_leaf(const binary_tree_t *node)`
- Checks if a node is a leaf
- Returns 1 if node is a leaf, 0 otherwise

### Task 5: Is root
**Function:** `int binary_tree_is_root(const binary_tree_t *node)`
- Checks if a node is a root
- Returns 1 if node is a root, 0 otherwise

### Task 6: Pre-order traversal
**Function:** `void binary_tree_preorder(const binary_tree_t *tree, void (*func)(int))`
- Goes through a binary tree using pre-order traversal
- Applies function to each node's value

### Task 7: In-order traversal
**Function:** `void binary_tree_inorder(const binary_tree_t *tree, void (*func)(int))`
- Goes through a binary tree using in-order traversal
- Applies function to each node's value

### Task 8: Post-order traversal
**Function:** `void binary_tree_postorder(const binary_tree_t *tree, void (*func)(int))`
- Goes through a binary tree using post-order traversal
- Applies function to each node's value

### Task 9: Height
**Function:** `size_t binary_tree_height(const binary_tree_t *tree)`
- Measures the height of a binary tree
- Height of NULL tree is 0
- Height of leaf node is 0

### Task 10: Depth
**Function:** `size_t binary_tree_depth(const binary_tree_t *node)`
- Measures the depth of a node in a binary tree
- Depth of root is 0

### Task 11: Size
**Function:** `size_t binary_tree_size(const binary_tree_t *tree)`
- Measures the size of a binary tree
- Size = number of nodes in tree

### Task 12: Leaves
**Function:** `size_t binary_tree_leaves(const binary_tree_t *tree)`
- Counts the leaves in a binary tree
- Leaves = nodes with no children

### Task 13: Nodes
**Function:** `size_t binary_tree_nodes(const binary_tree_t *tree)`
- Counts the nodes with at least 1 child in a binary tree

### Task 14: Balance factor
**Function:** `int binary_tree_balance(const binary_tree_t *tree)`
- Measures the balance factor of a binary tree
- Balance factor = height(left) - height(right)

### Task 15: Is full
**Function:** `int binary_tree_is_full(const binary_tree_t *tree)`
- Checks if a binary tree is full
- Full tree: every node has 0 or 2 children

### Task 16: Is perfect
**Function:** `int binary_tree_is_perfect(const binary_tree_t *tree)`
- Checks if a binary tree is perfect
- Perfect tree: all levels completely filled

### Task 17: Sibling
**Function:** `binary_tree_t *binary_tree_sibling(binary_tree_t *node)`
- Finds the sibling of a node
- Returns pointer to sibling node, or NULL

### Task 18: Uncle
**Function:** `binary_tree_t *binary_tree_uncle(binary_tree_t *node)`
- Finds the uncle of a node
- Returns pointer to uncle node, or NULL

## 🛡️ Edge Cases Handled
- **NULL pointers**: Functions handle NULL input gracefully
- **Empty trees**: Operations on empty trees return appropriate values
- **Single node trees**: Functions work correctly with single nodes
- **Invalid operations**: Appropriate return values for invalid operations

## 🔄 Tree Types Supported

| Tree Type | Definition |
|-----------|------------|
| Binary Tree | Each node has at most 2 children |
| Full Binary Tree | Every node has 0 or 2 children |
| Perfect Binary Tree | All levels completely filled |
| Complete Binary Tree | All levels except possibly last are filled |

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

### Potential Extensions
- **Binary Search Trees (BST)**: Insert, search, delete operations
- **AVL Trees**: Self-balancing binary search trees
- **Heap Operations**: Max-heap and min-heap implementations
