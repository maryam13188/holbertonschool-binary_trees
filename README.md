# Binary Trees

## 📖 Description
 data structures where each node has at most two children, enabling efficient data operations and serving as foundational building blocks for advanced algorithms and real-world applications like databases and AI systems.

## Learning Objectives

* What is a binary tree
* What is the difference between a binary tree and a Binary Search Trees
* What is the possible gain in terms of time complexity compared to linked lists
* What are the depth, the height, the size of a binary tree
* What are the different traversal methods to go through a binary tree
*  What is a complete, a full, a perfect, a balanced binary tree

## Requirements  

* Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
* All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
* All your files should end with a new line
* A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
* Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
* You are not allowed to use global variables
* No more than 5 functions per file
* You are allowed to use the standard library
* In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you * do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples
* The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called binary_trees.h
* Don’t forget to push your header file
* All your header files should be include guarded

## 🎯 Tasks Implementation
## Task 0: New node
**Function:**  ّbinary_tree_t *binary_tree_node(binary_tree_t *parent, int value)

- Creates a binary tree node

- Returns pointer to new node, or NULL on failure

## Task 1: Insert left
**Function:** binary_tree_t *binary_tree_insert_left(binary_tree_t *parent, int value)

- Inserts a node as the left-child of another node

- If parent already has a left-child, new node takes its place

## Task 2: Insert right
**Function:** binary_tree_t *binary_tree_insert_right(binary_tree_t *parent, int value)

- Inserts a node as the right-child of another node

- If parent already has a right-child, new node takes its place

## Task 3: Delete
**Function:** void binary_tree_delete(binary_tree_t *tree)

- Deletes an entire binary tree

- Uses post-order traversal

## Task 4: Is leaf
**Function:** int binary_tree_is_leaf(const binary_tree_t *node)

- Checks if a node is a leaf

- Returns 1 if node is a leaf, 0 otherwise

## Task 5: Is root
**Function:** int binary_tree_is_root(const binary_tree_t *node)

- Checks if a node is a root

- Returns 1 if node is a root, 0 otherwise

## Task 6: Pre-order traversal
**Function:** void binary_tree_preorder(const binary_tree_t *tree, void (*func)(int))

- Goes through a binary tree using pre-order traversal

- Applies function to each node's value

## Task 7: In-order traversal
**Function:** void binary_tree_inorder(const binary_tree_t *tree, void (*func)(int))

- Goes through a binary tree using in-order traversal

- Applies function to each node's value

## Task 8: Post-order traversal
**Function:** void binary_tree_postorder(const binary_tree_t *tree, void (*func)(int))

- Goes through a binary tree using post-order traversal

- Applies function to each node's value

## Task 9: Height
**Function:** size_t binary_tree_height(const binary_tree_t *tree)

- Measures the height of a binary tree

- Height of NULL tree is 0

- Height of leaf node is 0

## Task 10: Depth
**Function:** size_t binary_tree_depth(const binary_tree_t *node)

- Measures the depth of a node in a binary tree

- Depth of root is 0

## Task 11: Size
**Function:** size_t binary_tree_size(const binary_tree_t *tree)

- Measures the size of a binary tree

- Size = number of nodes in tree

## Task 12: Leaves
**Function:** size_t binary_tree_leaves(const binary_tree_t *tree)

- Counts the leaves in a binary tree

- Leaves = nodes with no children

## Task 13: Nodes
**Function:** size_t binary_tree_nodes(const binary_tree_t *tree)

- Counts the nodes with at least 1 child in a binary tree

## Task 14: Balance factor
**Function:** int binary_tree_balance(const binary_tree_t *tree)

- Measures the balance factor of a binary tree

- Balance factor = height(left) - height(right)

## Task 15: Is full
**Function:** int binary_tree_is_full(const binary_tree_t *tree)

- Checks if a binary tree is full

- Full tree: every node has 0 or 2 children

## Task 16: Is perfect
**Function:** int binary_tree_is_perfect(const binary_tree_t *tree)

- Checks if a binary tree is perfect

- Perfect tree: all levels completely filled

## Task 17: Sibling
**Function:** binary_tree_t *binary_tree_sibling(binary_tree_t *node)
